## Main information about project 😥.
Unfortunately, the application is console-based, but I plan to add a GUI in the future as soon as I learn it. However, this project includes Java code structures along with MySQL database connections. <br/>

## How it works 🤪?
Firstly when we start the application we see menu: <br/>
