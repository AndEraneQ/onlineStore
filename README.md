## Main information about project 😥.
Unfortunately, the application is console-based, but I plan to add a GUI in the future as soon as I learn it. However, this project includes Java code structures along with MySQL database connections. <br/>

## How it works 🤪?
Firstly when we start the application we see menu: <br/>

Ofcorse we can login and register. If we login it depends if our accound have admin or user permision. If admin you will need to type if you want to log in as a user or an admin. <br/>

If u have user permission you dont have to type enything and you got logged on your accound. So you have 4 options: 
1 - Go To Shop <br/>
2 - Manage your budget <br/>

Now you can see how all options work: <br/>
